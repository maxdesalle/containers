# containers
 An implementation of the C++ Standard Library's `vector`, `stack` and `map` containers. 

## How to use it
if you want to try it out, simply clone this repository and execute the following commands:
```bash
make
```

You will then find two executables at the root of the repository:

- `containers-ft` contains all the tests for this implementation
- `containers-stl` contains all the tests for the official STL implementation

To use these tests, execute each in a different terminal window with the same seed (a random number of your choice), and compare the output.
